# Schema Design Example
Level: Phase 1

Notes and examples from a breakout by [Camille Villa](https://github.com/camillevilla) on April 10, 2017 for the SF Bumblebees üêù

## üí°Tip: Save / Load Schemas 
### Save
- Design your schema at [schemadesigner.devbootcamp.com](https://schemadesigner.devbootcamp.com)
- "Save/Load" button in top-right corner
- "Save XML"
- Copy XML from the Input/Output field into a .xml file, save file
- Take a screenshot of your schema, save as a .png
- Add and commit both files to your git repo

### Load
- Go to [schemadesigner.devbootcamp.com](https://schemadesigner.devbootcamp.com)
- "Save/Load" button in top-right corner
- Copy your .xml file into the Input/Output field
- "Load XML"

## Challenge: Upgrading our superhero database
![Spongebob heroes](spongebob_heroes.jpg)

Hall of Justice HR has provided us with a simple database of superheroes and sidekicks. We've been asked to implement a feature that will let us create profile pages with information about superheroes' and sidekicks' powers. How can we upgrade our database? Here's the table that we've started with. 

![Step 0 schema](superheroes_sidekicks_00.png)

We'll start by adding a join table for our superheroes and powers.

![Step 1 schema](superheroes_sidekicks_01.png)

Hmm. How can we add information about sidekicks' powers as well? 

### ‚ùå Attempt 1:

In our first attempt, we added a foreign key for sidekick in our `powers_superheroes` join table.

 ![Step 2 schema](superheroes_sidekicks_02.png)

 That was a quick fix! But it's less than ideal: it adds a bunch of null values to our database. Every superhero will have a null `sidekick_id` and every sidekick will have a null `superhero_id`.

### ‚ùå Attempt 2:

In our second attempt, we tried making a separate join table for powers and sidekicks.

![Step 3 schema](superheroes_sidekicks_03.png)

This isn't great either. Superheroes and sidekicks both have profile pages their name and superpowers. We'll end up creating a lot of repetitive code because of this conditional logic ("e.g. if it's a superhero, look for their powers in `powers_superheroes`. If it's a sidekick look in `powers_sidekicks`")

Another wrinkle: what happens when sidekicks graduate from their training and become superheroes? We'll have to make new copies of their information in both the `superheroes` and `powers_superheroes` tables.

### ‚úÖ Attempt 3:

In our final attempt, we instead re-imagine our sidekicks as part of a more generic superhero class . Our `superhero` table now has some additional fields: `rank` and `supervisor_id`.

![Step 4 schema](superheroes_sidekicks_04.png)

Great! Now we can enter a sidekick's information once and just change their rank once they get promoted to superhero. If we want to standardize input for the rank field, we might create another table for `ranks`.

### Next steps:
How would you change or expand our schema to allow for:
- superhero-sidekick "rotations"? (e.g. a sidekick might work with a different hero every three months)
