# DBC Guides

A collection of tutorials, presentations, and examples from my time as a student and mentor at [Dev Bootcamp](https://devbootcamp.com/). Most of these are written to complement the DBC curriculum. More generalizable resources will eventually end up on [my blog](https://camillevilla.github.io).
