  - mention that you’re a new contributor!
- Get clarification if any of the acceptance criteria are unclear
- Fork the project, clone down the repo
- Follow any installation instructions and run the tests
- If the tests aren’t passing: ask for help troubleshooting your dev environment
- Start working on the code you’re interest in
  - If you’re updating code: comment out the method you’ll be working on and see which tests break. If no tests break, proceed with caution.
